# rustytron
Small game meant to emulate the classic Robotron game for Bevy Jam #1

Currently based off a modified version of the Bevy Breakout example.

Player is moved using WASD controls

Roadmap:
  * Add player shooting system using arrow keys for orthagonal firing
  * Add enemy wave spawning with simple movement towards player
  * Add player health system and scoring on enemy defeated
  * Add additional weapon/enemy types
